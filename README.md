# Smart-Lights

### Problem
There was this day when I forgot to turn off the lights in my living room before heading out, and as I remembered it once I was outside, I wanted an easy way to 
switch it off. Because this was five years ago and because smart home systems weren't that popular and common, I wanted to solve this issue by myself using my 
electronics and programming knowledge.

### Solution
With the help of an Arduino and a simple LED light to test out the entire project with an Ethernet Shield to connect to the Internet, I used HTTP GET requests to 
effectively turn off and on the LED from anywhere and at anytime by managing the flow of data using an SQL database and a PHP backend. Check out how it works [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=24&v=NMVVKpt7PHo&feature=emb_logo)!
